# ASCIIRotatingCube

Had a day off, worked on trying and implement a pseudo-3D engine from scratch used to render a ASCII cube.
The main challenges of this mini-project were 3D rotations and 3D->2D conversion with depth

The terminal size needed to see the projection properly is 130x50, but it can be changed in the code to
whichever values you prefer, by tweaking the width and height variables just above the main function
